Darling, I'm with St. Bernards
And we are scouring the Alps and the Andes
And if they die then it is on my head
They follow paw prints in the snow to my throne, to my bed

You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking, still yawning
We're proving to each other that romance is boring
Sure, there are things I could do if I was half-prepared to
Prove to each other that romance is boring
Start as you mean to continue
Complacent and self-involved
You're trying not to be nervous
If you were trying at all
I will wake, I will bake phallic cake
Take your diffidence, make it my clubhouse
But my strength's within lies, ventricle cauterised
It's the way of living that I espouse

You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking, still yawning
We're proving to each other that romance is boring
Sure, there are things I could do if I was half-prepared to
Prove to each other that romance is boring

We are two ships that pass in the night
You and I, we are nothing alike
I am a pleasure cruise, you are gone out to trawl
Return nets empty, nothing at all

You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking, still yawning
We're proving to each other that romance is boring
Sure, there are things I could do if I was half-prepared to
Prove to each other that romance is boringYou might also like5Embed","Romance Is Boring Lyrics Darling, I'm with St. Bernards And we are scouring the Alps and the Andes And if they die then it is on my head They follow paw prints in the snow to my throne, to my bed  You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking, still yawning We're proving to each other that romance is boring Sure, there are things I could do if I was half-prepared to Prove to each other that romance is boring Start as you mean to continue Complacent and self-involved You're trying not to be nervous If you were trying at all I will wake, I will bake phallic cake Take your diffidence, make it my clubhouse But my strength's within lies, ventricle cauterised It's the way of living that I espouse  You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking, still yawning We're proving to each other that romance is boring Sure, there are things I could do if I was half-prepared to Prove to each other that romance is boring  We are two ships that pass in the night You and I, we are nothing alike I am a pleasure cruise, you are gone out to trawl Return nets empty, nothing at all  You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking, still yawning We're proving to each other that romance is boring Sure, there are things I could do if I was half-prepared to Prove to each other that romance is boringYou might also like5Embed",0.335,0.931,6,-2.65,0,0.0436,0.00334,3.57e-05,0.236,0.545,128.438,155853,4

I pushed your head down
Flat onto the page
I held the weapon
Flat against your face
I remembered the promise
That I had made
And turned the pen back
Back onto myself

So you can stick your words of comfort
And you can take your well wishes too
Singing allez les blues
'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues
I know your shape and
I know your size
You are the weight of the concrete boots
That pull me under the tide
And now you’re marching on to a different drum
Leaving my body here without a beat
A body drained of all feeling
Could be nothing but a piece of meat

So you can stick your words of comfort
And you can take your well wishes too
We're singing allez les blues
'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues
'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues

This lump in my throat
Is the knot that you tied
With a flick of your tongue
And a wink of your eye
This lump in my throat
Is the knot that you tied
With a flick of your tongue
And a wink of your eye
This lump in my throat
(I’ve been sitting sidesaddle on the devil’s chair)
Is the knot that you tied
(I’ve been muddying upholstery, you didn’t care)
With a flick of your tongue
(We've been clinking glasses right into the dead of night)
And a wink of your eye
(Yeah, but the fire keeps me warm and keeps my heart alive)
This lump in my throat
(I’ve been sitting sidesaddle on the devil’s chair)
Is the knot that you tied
(I’ve been muddying upholstery, you didn’t care)
With a flick of your tongue
(We've been clinking glasses right into the dead of night)
He burns a fire, keeps me warm
And keeps my heart alive

Flat to my face
You remembered the promise
That you would break
But now the bloodline
Runs through my veins

'Cause they hold me closer than you would ever do
Allez les blues
They hold me closer than you would ever do
